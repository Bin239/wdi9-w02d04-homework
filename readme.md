For tonight's homework, take your pokemon game code or space battle game code and apply jQuery to run the game in your browser with useable, clickable interfaces instead of prompts and console.logs.
Display data and game state on the page using append, text, and other methods.
Change game state and accept user input by putting buttons on the page and adding event listeners. Try not to clog up the page with too many buttons! Remove them after they stop being relevant.
Try to refactor some of the complex or long parts of code into smaller functions, like in my Rock Paper Scissors example.
